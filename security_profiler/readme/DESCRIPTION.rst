This module lets log the security workflow of a specific user. Specifically,
each time the profiled user access to a model view or clicks on a menu,
that access or menu is logged.

Then, from this logged workflow, you can export a security proposal for that user.
This proposal will be a group, and access rights, actions and menu views for that group.
